# cuberhack: Personalized Learning with Blockchain and AI (MVP)

Cuberhack is building a revolutionary personalized learning system build on [Klaytn](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/docs/build/get-started/) that leverages the power of blockchain and AI to create an engaging and rewarding educational experience. Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on core functionalities to validate the concept and gather user feedback for future iterations.


## Key Features:
### Personalized Learning Paths:
- AI analyzes student performance data (stored securely on the blockchain) to identify strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles.
- Based on this analysis, the system recommends personalized learning paths with curated content (text, videos, quizzes) tailored to individual needs.

### Interactive Learning Modules:
- The platform offers interactive learning modules that leverage gamification elements to boost engagement.
- Modules may include quizzes, interactive exercises, and simulations that provide immediate feedback and track progress.

### Secure Blockchain Ledger:
- Student performance data, including completed modules, scores, and achievements, are stored immutably on a blockchain ledger.
- This ensures data security, transparency, and tamper-proof records.

### Checkpoints and Attendance:
- The system incorporates checkpoints at strategic points within the learning path.
- Students must successfully complete checkpoints to progress further, ensuring mastery of key concepts.
- Attendance is recorded using a secure verification method (e.g., facial recognition, unique access codes).

### Performance Calculation and Rewards:
- An AI-powered engine calculates student performance based on various factors:
  - Completion of modules and checkpoints
  - Scores on quizzes and assessments
  - Time spent on learning activities
- Based on performance, students earn rewards and badges stored on the blockchain wallet.
  - These rewards can be:
    - Virtual badges and points redeemable for in-platform privileges.
    - Real-world benefits (optional) like redeemable points for discounts or educational resources.

## Key Technologies:
- Solidity
- NextJS

### Additional tools:
- Ethers
- Rainbow Kit
- Wagmi

## Benefits:
- **Personalized Learning:** Cater to individual student needs and learning styles.
- **Improved Engagement:** Gamification elements and interactive modules boost motivation.
- **Secure and Transparent Data:** Blockchain ensures tamper-proof records and data security.
- **Measurable Progress:** Track performance with clear checkpoints and progress reports.
- **Reward-Driven Learning:** Motivate students with a rewarding system that recognizes achievements.

## Next Steps:
1. Develop a user-friendly interface for students, educators, and administrators.
2. Integrate AI algorithms for personalized learning path generation.
3. Pilot test the MVP with a small group of students and educators.
4. Gather feedback and iterate based on user experience to improve the platform.

Cuberhack's personalized learning system has the potential to revolutionize education by creating a dynamic, secure, and rewarding learning environment for all.
